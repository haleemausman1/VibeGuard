VibeGuard is a full-stack healthcare web application that enables users to assess symptoms, explore potential medical conditions, discover treatment options, receive lifestyle recommendations, and connect with healthcare professionals. The platform is designed to make basic health information more accessible while providing users with personalized tools to monitor and manage their well-being.

In addition to symptom analysis, registered users can maintain a personal health dashboard to track vital health metrics, store symptom history, generate downloadable PDF reports, and manage their account securely. The platform also includes a comprehensive Admin Panel that allows administrators to manage body parts, symptoms, doctors, medicines, user accounts, and system data efficiently.

Built with a secure authentication system using JWT, cookies, and MongoDB, VibeGuard is fully responsive across desktop and mobile devices, providing a seamless user experience while ensuring data security and reliability.
